<context>
Phase 2 UAT revealed a bug where the dashboard API routes were defined without the /admin prefix.
Auth routes (login, logout, session) had the correct prefix, but dashboard-api routes didn't.
This caused 404 errors from the frontend since it was calling /admin/api/apps but backend only had /api/apps.

The fix was straightforward - added /admin prefix to all 6 routes in dashboard-api.ts.

Local dev environment setup:
- Backend: pnpm dev (port 3000)
- Frontend: pnpm dashboard:dev (port 5173, proxies to backend)
- Admin credentials: admin / admin123
