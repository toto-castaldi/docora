<current_state>
Project initialized, research complete, roadmap created. Phase 1 not yet planned.
No execution has started — this is the "ready to begin" state.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Project questioning: Admin dashboard requirements gathered (Italian)
- Codebase mapping: 7 documents in .planning/codebase/
- Research: 5 documents in .planning/research/ (stack, features, arch, pitfalls, summary)
- Roadmap: 5 phases defined in .planning/ROADMAP.md
- Requirements: 8 DASH-* requirements in .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
- Config: YOLO mode, quality profile, parallel execution enabled
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Plan Phase 1 (Foundation & Authentication)
- Execute Phase 1
- Continue through phases 2-5
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Stack: React 19 + Vite 6 + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query/Table
- Architecture: pnpm monorepo with dashboard/ and packages/shared-types/
- Auth: httpOnly session cookies (separate from client Bearer tokens)
- Serving: @fastify/static with SPA fallback on /admin
- Polling over WebSocket for v1 simplicity
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- Admin credential management: Need to decide env var vs database table (recommended: env vars for v1)
- Test coverage: Research recommends >80% on client API routes before changes
</blockers>

<context>
Docora Admin Dashboard project for Toto. Goal: "See failures before clients report them, fix with one click."

Currently monitoring workers via logs when clients complain. Dashboard will show:
- Failed notifications with error details
- Job queue status (pending/running counts)
- Registered apps and their repositories
- History of sent updates
- Retry functionality

User prefers Italian communication but all docs in English.
CLAUDE.md updated to allow commits but not pushes.

<next_action>
Start with: /gsd:discuss-phase 1 (or /gsd:plan-phase 1 to skip discussion)

This will decompose Phase 1 into executable plans covering:
1. pnpm workspace monorepo structure
2. Admin session authentication with httpOnly cookies
3. Isolated /admin/api/* routes with separate auth plugin
4. Type-sharing between backend and frontend
</next_action>
