## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- 14-02: Delete release job entirely (no reusable parts for Phase 16); comment out docker/deploy jobs to preserve config references for Phase 16
- 14-01: Version reset to 0.0.0 as neutral placeholder; conventional commit format retained as preferred informal style

### Pending Todos

None.
