# ver 1.0.0

## Milestone 1 : setup

The first milestone is the setup. From this first milestone, I expect to have a prototype of a service that responds on a cloud-hosted server, exposing a REST API. It is sufficient for it to return “hello world.”

This API will be developed in TypeScript. There will be a Docker Compose configuration that starts the service. Everything will be installed automatically through a GitHub Action that performs the build and the deployment.

As mentioned, the language is TypeScript, and the versioning system described in versioning.md in the docs folder will be used. Essentially, this is semantic versioning.

Therefore, I expect everything to work correctly, including the deployment and versioning systems. The setup must also include the ability to develop everything locally in an easy way.
