backlog
=======

- [ ] onboarding process will be allowed only for Authenticated (e.g. google and/or single key) clients. Now anyone/anythink can do a lot of registrations
- [ ] Rename detection: detect file renames as a single operation instead of delete + create (compare file hashes to identify moved files)
