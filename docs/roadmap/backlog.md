backlog
=======

- [ ] onboarding process will be allowed only for Authenticated (e.g. google and/or single key) clients. Now anyone/anythink can do a lot of registrations
- [ ] Rename detection: detect file renames as a single operation instead of delete + create (compare file hashes to identify moved files)
- [x] ~~Periodic re-scanning: automatically re-scan synced repositories at configurable intervals to detect changes~~ (Implemented in Milestone 06)
- [ ] GitHub webhooks integration: receive push notifications from GitHub instead of polling, for real-time change detection
