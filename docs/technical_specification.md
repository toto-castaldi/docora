# Versioning System

Follows the strategy defined in `versioning.md`:

- **Single source of truth**: `src/version.ts`
- **Conventional Commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- **Auto-release**: GitHub Actions analyzes commits and bumps version
- **Semantic Versioning**: `feat` → MINOR, `fix` → PATCH, `!` → MAJOR

# Docker

In prod Docora is running with a Docker Compose stack.
In dev all needed services are executed by a single container.

# Database

PostgreSQL 16
Schema managed via Liquibase (YAML format)

**Tables:**
- `apps` - Registered third-party applications
- `repositories` - GitHub repositories being monitored
- `app_repositories` - Junction table (apps ↔ repositories)
- `repository_snapshots` - Last known state of repositories
- `snapshot_files` - File metadata for change detection

# Worker

Docora runs in two modes controlled by `RUN_MODE` environment variable:

| Mode | Description | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `api` | API server only | `pnpm dev` |
| `worker` | Background worker only | `pnpm worker` |
| `all` | Both API and worker | `RUN_MODE=all pnpm dev` |

The worker handles:
- Repository cloning/pulling
- File scanning with `.docoraignore` support
- Snapshot notifications to registered apps
- Retry with exponential backoff

| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | AES-256 key for token encryption |
| `REPOS_BASE_PATH` | Local path for cloned repositories |
| `RUN_MODE` | `api`, `worker`, or `all` |

# Authentication Flow

## App → Docora (API calls)

Apps authenticate to Docora using a Bearer token issued during onboarding.

```
POST /api/repositories
Authorization: Bearer {app_token}
```

The `app_token` is returned once during onboarding and stored as a bcrypt hash in Docora's database.

## Docora → App (Webhooks)

When Docora sends notifications to apps, it uses HMAC signature authentication.

### client_auth_key

During onboarding, the app provides a `client_auth_key` which is:
- Generated by the app before onboarding
- Sent to Docora during `POST /api/apps/onboard`
- Stored encrypted (AES-256) in the `apps.client_auth_key_encrypted` column
- Used to compute HMAC signatures (NEVER transmitted after onboarding)

### HMAC Signature Authentication

Every webhook request includes these headers:

```
X-Docora-App-Id: {app_id}
X-Docora-Signature: sha256={hmac_signature}
X-Docora-Timestamp: {unix_timestamp}
```

**Why HMAC instead of Bearer token?**
- Bearer tokens expose the secret in every request
- If a webhook is intercepted, attacker gets the secret and can forge requests
- With HMAC, the secret is NEVER transmitted after onboarding
- Each signature is unique to the payload, preventing replay attacks

### Signature Computation

```
payload = timestamp + "." + JSON.stringify(body)
signature = HMAC-SHA256(payload, client_auth_key)
```

### Verification Steps (Client Side)

1. Verify `X-Docora-App-Id` matches expected app
2. Verify `X-Docora-Timestamp` is within 5 minutes of current time
3. Recompute signature using stored `client_auth_key`
4. Compare signatures using constant-time comparison
